Boxes will come in bundles of 500 pcs in each. I only have 33 bundles available, and no new ones will be offered with this arrangement. When you are sure that you want to be a part of my project, please let me know by sending me a message on Facebook, and I will arrange a contract which we both sign and scan and email each other. The reason for these bundles is to minimize future administrative workload. If you wish to buy fewer boxes, see if you can partner with some friends, or contact me and I will see if I can partner you with someone in the same situation. But remember full bundle buyers will have priority on availability, so you might end up without any. <br><br>

(it will be fully extended to about 120 meters with two rows when all fine adjustments are completed), you will pay the next third, $1334 to us. The machine you will be shown will still not be completed nor operational, but it will show you our progress. <br><br>

                                    <strong class="text-yellow">Time plan</strong> - The estimated time plan for the first full-length machine to be in production, is slightly more than a year from now, at around the beginning of 2025. Normally you will receive your rental fees after your boxes have been in full production for a full year, BUT, as you may have been waiting for such a long time then, I will try to prioritize your first rental fee as soon as production income allows for it. The current estimate is that you will get your first rental payment sometime around mid-2025. But remember, these time frames are just rough estimates.

But it will also have the highest long-term rewards with unlimited growth. You will be given free boxes as the project grows, if we grow for example to having 100 machines in the future, you will be given 99 free boxes, for every box you initially purchased, totaling 100 boxes including the one you purchased for $8, and earn you a rental fee of $120 which equals to a 1500% yearly return from them. AND you will also be given first priority on any future offerings as well, based on your box holding volume. Price per bundle is $4000, but you only pay a third now, $1334 which will secure your 1 bundle of 500 boxes. Later in February-March 2024, you will pay the next third $1334, after you have been shown our progress with a full-sized machine, 5.5 meters tall, but shorter at 15 meters long. (it will be fully extended to about 120 meters with two rows with 49,500 boxes each when all fine adjustments are completed) The machine you will be shown will still not be completed nor operational, but it will show you our progress. In May-June 2024, you will pay the last third, $1333 after you have been shown a complete but still short version, with 5 service robots (software might not be final yet though, so time will tell how much they will move around automatically at this demonstration.
