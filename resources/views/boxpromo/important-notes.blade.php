If it drops to below 80%, those boxes’ rental income and accountable time for free boxes will also be reduced to the same percentage, but only for that specific machine. Let’s say we have 25 machines in full production, your initial $8 box will have earned you 24 free boxes after many years, which will earn you a yearly rental income of $30 (375%). But bad times might force us to pause 4.5 machines for a while, then you will only earn a full income and accountable time from boxes in 20 machines and 50% from the machine that runs at half capacity = 20.5 boxes x $1.2 = $24.6 (307.5%). This also applies in the case of any kind of accident or disaster that might limit a machine’s production capacity.

If the market price drops to $11.99 per kilo or below (currently $18), then your rental income will drop to 50% ($0.6) and accountable time for free boxes will be paused till prices stabilize at $12 or above.
