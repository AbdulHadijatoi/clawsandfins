And as <strong>we are the only one in the world,</strong> who has automated this soft-shell crab production process, which will produce an unrivaled product quality and to an extremely low production cost, it is not impossible that we could become the dominant player on this market.

                                    <br>
                                    As many of you already know, I have been working on a large AI-driven high-tech soft-shell crab project for a while. Now after almost 7 years and 40-50,000 hours of project development, testing, prototyping, researching, designing, etc, etc, the project is reaching a final phase, and we have started to build our first full sized, but shorter machine (15m), which will be extended later (120m). And I need your help to speed things up. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Take a look at the project’s <a class="text-yellow" href="{{url('timeline/')}}">7-year long timeline with MANY photos.</a>

                                        <strong class="text-yellow"></strong> So I would like to ask you, would you be interested in being a part of my project, and experience the project from the inside, through its ups and downs, and follow the development process, and perhaps even get personally involved and providing the project with your unique skillsets and life experiences, as well as earning a good growing income from it?

                                        <strong class="text-yellow">My invitation </strong> - I hereby offer you to be a part of my crab project by helping me to acquire boxes for use in my machine, and from which you will earn a <strong>constantly growing</strong> income from, as the project grows larger.

                                        <strong class="text-yellow">How will it work?</strong> – You buy as many boxes you want for (US$8) each, and rent them out to me, for use in my machine, and I will pay you a 15% (US$1.2) yearly rental fee for them. <strong>Additionally,</strong> as a token of my gratitude for your early belief in me and my project, and for you who have then patiently waited for over 18 months before your boxes start generating you an income, I will be more than happy to share the project’s profit with you, by giving you a free box for every new machine we get into production, for every box you helped us with at the beginning, which also generate you a 15% (US$1.2) return each. With this arrangement your income will increase at the same pace as the whole project grows.

                                            With 2 machines in production, you will have the box you first paid US$8 for, plus 1 box you got for free and you will earn 15% (US$1.2) each from both of them, which totaling at US$2.4.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            And when we have 10 machines after few years, you will still have your first box that you paid US$8 for, plus 9 free boxes as well, and earn 15% (US$1.2) each from all 10 of them, which totaling at US$12.

                                    <strong class="text-yellow">Customer is waiting</strong> - We actually have a distribution request from a Korean customer already. A customer who has followed our project for over 4 years, and have also visited us in Vietnam, at two different occasions. He is asking for delivery of roughly 20 tons of soft-shell crabs per month, worth roughly US$4.3 million per year, which equals production in 2-3 machines. And the Korean customer also believes that he can increase this volume significantly to 30-50 tons as soon as the current economic recession is over. So, just to satisfy this one single customer’s future demands, we may be required to have between 3-6 machines… And with 20-50 of such customers from different countries around the world, we may be required to have 50-300 machines in production within 10 years.

And given that funds are available, a machine can be built within 3 months and pay for itself in 6-8 months.
