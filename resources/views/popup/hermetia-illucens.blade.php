    Hermetia illucens, known commonly as black soldier fly larva (BSFL), larvaes are among the most efficient animals on the planet at converting organic waste into biomass. The black soldier fly (BSF) has been studied extensively due to its various benefits. For example, it produces antibacterial substances, cleans infected wounds, recycles bio-organic waste, and is not considered a pest or a vector for diseases. Leftover waste from the larvae also contains natural compounds suitable for vegetable farming.
